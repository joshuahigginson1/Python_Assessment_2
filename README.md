# Python Assessment 2 - Thursday 30th July 2020

In the first python assessment within the QA Academy, I got 8/10. In the practice exam for the second python assessment, I got 9/10. This repository contains my second official assessment at QA. Looking back some time later, there's so much I'd change, but I think it's quite cool that I've got some old, old code as reference to my progress.
